# PCB-Mini-Environmental-Sensor
This is a compact environmental monitoring PCB design that enables precise tracking of multiple atmospheric parameters with the following features:

🌡️ Monitors temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure using BME280 sensor
💨 Measures air quality and CO2 equivalent with Sensirion SPG40 sensor
📶 WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity via ESP32-C3-VROOM-02 microcontroller
🔋 Battery-powered operation with 3.7V Li-ion battery and USB-C charging
⚡ Efficient power management using TPS62203 step-down converter
🔄 Automatic data logging with cloud connectivity capabilities
💤 Ultra-low power consumption with deep sleep mode (10μA)
🌧️ Weather-resistant design suitable for indoor and outdoor use

# Usage
To use the environmental sensor node, follow these steps:

  1. Power the device using either the 3.7V battery or USB-C connection
  2. Place the sensor in your desired monitoring location (indoor or outdoor)
  3. Connect to WiFi using the device's configuration interface
  4. Monitor environmental data in real-time through the web dashboard
  5. Analyze historical trends
  6. Receive alerts when environmental parameters exceed safe levels

The device automatically optimizes power consumption by entering deep sleep between measurements, ensuring extended battery life while providing continuous environmental monitoring for smart home, agricultural, and industrial applications.
